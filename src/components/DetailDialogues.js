      <p>The calculator uses the study’s results to calculate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="font-weight-bold">an estimate of a household's carbon fee costs</span> under the policy (due
          to higher prices for goods and services), depending on a limited set of household characteristics (income,
          number of vehicles etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-weight-bold">the expected dividend</span>, which is a function of the household's number
          of adults, number of minors, and expected federal marginal tax rate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-weight-bold">the "estimated gain per month"</span> -- the difference between the
          dividend and additional cost - positive if a household is likely to "come out ahead" under the Energy
          Innovation and Carbon Dividend proposal.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How accurate is the calculator?</h4>
      <p>
        For ease of use, a small and generally easy-to-recall set of user inputs are solicited. The calculator reports
        the expected average outcome for a household. The actual outcome for any specific household could vary from the
        average. For example, if your household is a below-average consumer of carbon-intensive goods like air travel
        and meat, the calculator will understate the estimated gain (and vice-versa). Developing a precise estimate for
        every household would require many more questions and accurate recall. We have opted for simplicity over
        precision.
